starter_scripts:

    generate_results.py: the place where you build your submission

                        (similiar to TrackFactory class in ppd)

    generate_submission.py: 

        writes to random_submission.json

    
scorer_scripts:

    score_detections.py

        -g 

    python scorer_scripts_v2/scorer_scripts_v2/score_detections.py -g starter_scripts_v2/starter_scripts_v2/training_GT_labels_v2.json -p starter_scripts_v2/starter_scripts_v2/random_submission.json

look for people on github with these file names?
lookn for code keywords?

we don't get labels for test dataset,
    but we could build those our self

iiuc, the leaderboard images are the exact ones we're operating on
for our score on the leaderboard

what is % score on the leaderboard for accuracy only right?

where in the submission.json is CI being written?

IuC, mAP - define

what is the 9th position in random_submission file? why 0.5?
    the ground truth only has eight

resolve the labels / "ground truth" file versioning controversy
    i have v2, it was uploaded when ?
    when is the latest complaint on the forum ?
    Feb20 was complaint/response

do we upload code for test2 or only test3?

why does ground truth only have one bounding box?

no gate -> submission should have empty brackets

we can use scorer to figure out the expected score from a naive/baseline avg algo
    -> avg coord from training_labels.json
        adjust for vert/horiz align
        or we can just hand score em

free gpu instances?

    The internal clearance is 8ft x 8ft, the external dimensions are 11ft x 11ft, and the depth is 1ft.

    libraries should be compatible with Python 3.5.2

TODO

    [x] correct glob issue, path name in submission.json keys
    [x] run score_detections on training data

        python scorer_scripts_v2/scorer_scripts_v2/score_detections.py -g training_GT_labels_v2.json -p random_submission3.json

    [x] plot in matplotlib in notebook

    [x] cv draw polygon
    
    [x] build a avg point submission
        [x] get it's score
        [x] first, just with inner box
        [x] run pred=truth, cocoMap? 0.91
        [ ] build mini training set
        [x] build second box, score
        
        inner rect is 8'x8', and frame is 3'
            -> ratio is 3/8 *width or 3/8*height

        second box won't help our local score:
            the ground truth has no second box!

    [~] how does generate_submission build something different than
        our mean_prediction.json?
        -> still, idk

2/26

    [x] build mini training-set

    [x] score() takes dict not fn

    [x] utils gets calcMean functions
        [x] run on mini1 vs mini2

    [x] pred=actual on mini-sets

    [x] label images task
        [x] run program
        [~] determine my block 7500 - 7999
            [~] verify this with other submissions
        [x] start a trial
            [x] verify -j output works
            [x] verify an alter frame
            [x] find a mislabel
        [~] how do we handle corner out-of-frame?

    [ ] breakout cocoMAP for individual images / indvidual corners

    [x] perform search on baseline ideal rect

    [~] build roiSelect tool (for leader set)

    [~] bring in pyzbar, try to work it

    [x] Install Python3 + TF + OpenCV
        - got 64 bit python 3.7.2
            per: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?lang=python3
        - put python37/ on system path
        - rename python37/python.exe - >python37/python3.exe
        - but now pip is broken: so...
            python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
            -> now pip3 --version works
        >where python vs >where python3
        >where pip vs >where pip3
        
        [x] Jupyter for py3:
            >pip3 install jupyter
        
        
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28831854/how-do-i-add-python3-kernel-to-jupyter-ipython

            >jupyter kernelspec list

        we can control which jupyter server launches with:
        >python[3] -m jupyter notebook
            >python3 -m jupyter --version  -> 4.4.0 
              vs
            >python -m jupyter --version    -> 4.3.0

        [x] Tensorflow
            >pip3 install --user --upgrade tensorflow
            >python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; tf.enable_eager_execution(); print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random_normal([1000, 1000])))"

                tf.Tensor(-48.9541, shape=(), dtype=float32)

        [x] OpenCV

            https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/

            >pip3 install --upgrade opencv-contrib-python

            import cv2; cv2.__version__
            > 4.0.0

        [x] Maplotlib

            >pip3 installl --upgrade matplotlib

        [ ] 2to3? to fix my modules?

            thoughts:
            i rely on python2 division style to return a rounded int , how can i insure this stays in py3?
